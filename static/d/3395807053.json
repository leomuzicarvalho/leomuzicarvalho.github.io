Famous as it is, it deserves a good-looking and functional ecommmerce, ready for their most exigeant customers. The website had a old style and, at the beginning, scripts were nocive for its performance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My main goal when I joined CCM ecommerce was to rebuild the website, because it has passed by the hands of plenty of code agencies, which left the front end really messy, hard to read and with bunches of scripts that weights the website and goes against the user experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, Vtex has a good arsenal of tools, such as <strong>VtexIO</strong>, which uses <strong>React.js</strong> in its background and will surelly be usefull for rebuilding the ecommerce and bringing high performance. I'm currently working on it and it's my goal for 2020.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although it has much impprovement to be done, CCM has already grown its recipe in the last year and have a good perspective for 2020 thanks to all the good changes made for user experience.</li>\n<li>The core points to be impproved have already been spotted and it is now a matter of time so everthing will be SEO and customer experience optimized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next steps and news will be available here as the development goes on, please if you're interested, feel free to visit <a href=\"https://www.ccm.net.br\" target=\"__blank\"><strong>CCM Gym Deluxe</strong></a> and checkout how the website looks like today!</p>"}]}}}
