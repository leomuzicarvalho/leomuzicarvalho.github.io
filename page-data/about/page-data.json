Since then, I've been impproving my skills with the most used tools for web development nowadays, such as <strong>ReactJS</strong>,<strong>GatsbyJS</strong> (which is used on this site) and <strong>NodeJS</strong>, for example.</p>\n<h2>My Skills and Experiences</h2>\n<p>I strongly consider myself as independent and self-taught. Like stated above, my first experience in the market was as a Web Developer for a Vtex Ecommerce in Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.ccm.net.br/\">CCM Gym Deluxe</a>. In the past, I've done lots of solo projects and freelancing since 2016, even using <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> and lots of <strong>Python</strong>. My next stage of experience was here, in <strong>Barrie - ON</strong>, where I live now, as a Junior Web Developer for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/marketplace-solutions-inc/\">Marketplace Solutions</a>, building <strong>ReactJS</strong> pages with <strong>GatsbyJS</strong> and <strong>GraphQL</strong>. I also have a good experience with <strong>SQL</strong> language, as I've done quite a lot of work at University with <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. Nowadays I'm looking for opportunities of putting in practice all my data analysis skills alogn with my <strong>Python</strong> Machine Learning and data manipulation skills.</p>\n<h2>This is just the beginning</h2>\n<p>Of course, there is still much to learn. Make sure you've already checked <a href=\"/#Portfolio\">all my works</a> here on this website, to see what we can achieve working together. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out for me clicking on my social media links at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<h2>What comes next?</h2>\n<p>In January 2020, I joined Canada to study Big Data Analytics, a post-graduation program, at Georgian College in Barrie - Ontario, so I can expand my possibilities in this wide field of technology. The next step is to actively pursue an opportunity for me to put all my knowledge into producing results for whoever trust my potential. And of course, we are all eternal learners and so am I, I'll always keep studying to expand my knowledge and skills to keep reaching farther.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/about","title":"My story","onBanner":"Here goes something about me"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
